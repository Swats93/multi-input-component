Few assumptions are taken into consideration :

1. A user can add a new item after clicking enter on the last input.
2. On cancel, all the inputs filled by the user will not save and the user will see the initial starting screen of multi-input.
3. On clicking save, all the inputs filled by the user will be saved in an array.
4. A user can edit the field by just clicking on the input which he/she want to edit.
